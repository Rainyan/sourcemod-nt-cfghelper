sourcemod-nt-cfghelper
======================

This plugin was created to counter certain trolls creating malicious SRCDS servers that would change the connected players' binds
to spam stuff. It uses a filter to detect affected players, and automatically suggests/rebinds their keyboard layout back to
game defaults. Created for Neotokyo, but should work in any Source game.
